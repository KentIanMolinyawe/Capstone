            <h1>Introduction</h1>  
            <p>
                The project aims to establish a dedicated online platform for e-bike retail, 
                catering to the growing demand for sustainable transportation solutions. 
                While acknowledging the value of social media for promotion, the project focuses on overcoming its 
                limitations by creating a specialized website. This website will offer a fully 
                customizable and immersive e-commerce experience, addressing challenges such as limited customization 
                and control over user experience. By leveraging the flexibility of a dedicated website, the project seeks 
                to provide seamless browsing, efficient product selection, and streamlined payment processing, 
                fostering confidence and loyalty among users. Additionally, robust e-commerce functionalities 
                will be implemented, including transaction history and digital receipts, to maximize user satisfaction 
                and engagement. The ultimate goal is to establish a professional and reliable e-bike retail presence 
                that inspires trust, drives conversions, and promotes sustainable mobility solutions.

            <h2>Scope and Limitation</h2>
            Vivien De Luna
                The project will facilitate seamless browsing of e-bikes, 
                allowing users to explore various models and features effortlessly. 
                Users will also have access to detailed descriptions of each e-bike, providing comprehensive information to 
                aid in decision-making. Additionally, we will focus on developing a robust ticketing system to manage customer 
                inquiries efficiently, along with implementing SMS capabilities to enhance communication with customers 
                regarding their inquiries or orders. Furthermore, our project will address data transaction management to 
                ensure smooth handling and processing of customer interactions and transactions.

                In today's digital landscape, the convergence of e-commerce and sustainable transportation is underscored 
                by key themes elucidated in recent research. User experience stands as a cornerstone in e-commerce success,
                with intuitive navigation, streamlined checkout processes, and mobile optimization identified as critical 
                factors by Tan (2021). Concurrently, the surge in interest in sustainable transportation solutions, 
                particularly electric bikes, is bolstered by online platforms and digital marketing strategies, as noted 
                by MacArthur et al. (2019) and Parkin et al. (2020). These strategies, encompassing effective SEO techniques 
                and digital advertising campaigns, amplify visibility and attract organic traffic. Chen and Popovich (2003) 
                assert the pivotal role of efficient customer support systems, emphasizing the need for streamlined ticketing 
                solutions and knowledge bases. Moreover, the integration of SMS capabilities, as explored by Zhang et al. (2019) 
                and Wang et al. (2021), serves to enhance communication and deliver timely updates to users. In the 
                realm of cross-border e-commerce, Chaffey et al. (2019) and Li and Li (2020) advocate for internationalization 
                strategies, including localization and adaptation to cultural preferences, to effectively target global markets 
                and capitalize on the burgeoning demand for sustainable transportation solutions. Through a synthesis of these 
                insights, a holistic approach emerges, underlining the interconnectedness of user experience, digital promotion, 
                customer support, and internationalization in advancing both e-commerce and sustainable transportation agendas.
